# Easy CLI

This library allows you to easily set up a CLI for your project.
Concentrate on making your library or program, and then take only
a few minutes time to make it interactive with this library.

# Motivation

Before making this library, I had to re-create a CLI three times, because
I couldn't find one that would do what I wanted.
The need for it had two different reasons:

- I wanted a quick interface without needing to create a GUI
- I wanted to be able to closely interact and monitor my program in order to properly test it.

Obviously, an CLI is perfect for that.
It is a quick GUI that everyone tech-savy can easily interact with, and
you don't even need a minute to add your new method to it, in order to execute
and test it.
Especially in larger project, the last point is a big one, even with a Unit Test
framework.
